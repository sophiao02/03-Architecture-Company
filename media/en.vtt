00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.919
I'm an architect who loves to draw my

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:09.040
name is Barry burkas I'm in my studio in

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.280
Santa Barbara and we're going to look at

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.160
a house that we designed and tell you

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.080
how and why we designed the house the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.600
way it is clients came to us and they

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.359
said we want to build on the beach we

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.800
want to build in a place that has great

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.840
ocean views we want to build a house

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.039
that allows us to bring our extended

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.480
family home but we want to have a place

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.879
that's private for them also so we

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.879
looked at putting the Living Kitchen

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.960
across the back to enjoy the view the

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.800
library to enjoy the view a Stairway

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.879
that went upstairs so the master bedroom

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.440
sat over the top of the kitchen area and

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.000
a guest room over the living room and a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.039
bridge that connected that and the guest

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.559
over here and actually another bridge

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.960
that connected the guest to their own

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.359
bedroom suites which were over a motor

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.519
Court in the front so as you start to

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.399
this becomes a house it is a drawing

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.360
that as you start the sketch you you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.520
draw a diagram and the diagram becomes

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.400
architecture so what we were looking at

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.960
once again was the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.960
ocean that ran along the area here we're

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.200
looking at once again winds that came

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.439
from the west side over here Sun that

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.240
came east and west and we looked at the

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.040
kitchen being on the morning side of the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.920
house always think about the kitchen

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.880
enjoying East light that sun is a Wonder

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.640
wonderful thing to gain in the morning

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.840
in the afternoon the warmth in the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.960
living room and we looked at the house

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.119
as around a courtyard so that if the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.759
winds came that we would end up being

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.000
able to shelter the people around a

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.479
fireplace in a courtyard that we came

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.600
through from Motor Court which was the

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.079
garages in front so very simply then

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.880
this became the living room with a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.280
fireplace sitting in the floor seating

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.119
areas around the fireplace the dining

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.600
room in this area here the kitchen that

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.560
was back in this side of the house on

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.039
the east side with sun coming in in the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.439
morning and the idea that the library on

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.520
this edge of the house would enjoy the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.680
quiet and we could block the West sun

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.120
with that but we're watching the beach

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.840
looking at the surf looking at a pool

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.920
that sits in the yard and it became a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.800
place that water in an infinity pool

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.440
poured over into the ocean visually and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.360
then water in the front kept the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.360
Acoustics that were from the noise of

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.959
the road in this in the uh train away

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.599
from the iners of the house enter here

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.120
look to light look to the right the

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.800
library a piano look to the left through

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.480
the dining room towards the kitchen

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.360
views up and down the coast but all

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.519
houses that we work on be diagrams that

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.480
are bubbles then start to become harder

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.840
lines and the forms start to come

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.680
together and it's an exercise in

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.840
thinking with the hand and the mind that

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.760
will go from just a little bit more

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.840
detail than this to the computer where

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.519
it really becomes an organized piece put

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.120
together by the designers that are

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.000
working with me on the house so it all

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.159
begins as a pattern and a diagram the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.640
idea of where things are and how they

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.040
interrelate adjacencies and the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.040
opportunities of the Sun in the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.879
afternoon the sun in the morning the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.319
views to the water and the idea that the

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.319
bridge puts together the guest and the

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.720
master looking down into the wonderful

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.799
views of the house the people that have

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.599
this house are wonderful clients and

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.560
it's a house that we are very very proud

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.840
of as Architects and that I think is the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.480
greatest reward an architect can have is

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.760
a happy client a great building and a

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.080
place that they want to go back and

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.439
visit because of the meaning of the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.159
piece that they've designed and the

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.159
strength of the architecture
